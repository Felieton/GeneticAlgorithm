# Genetic Algorithm

## Intro
Genetic Algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. This project was also extended by simulated annealing. Research reports are located in the directory GeneticAlgorithm - reports.

## About
This project uses GA metaheuristic in order to design pins places on a PCB board. It uses mutation and crossovers and when it comes to selection: roulette and tournament.
